Please review the typography again based on the figma design

Titles «sweet skin» and «termin buchen», as well as «next generation dermatology» have too much spacing between the letters and between each line. Please use the figma draft as template.
the text font seems to be ‘thicker’ then on the design - not sure where that comes from. I’ll double check the font i sent you
Line height on text font is too big
Small Titles all have too much spacing between the letters. Text sizes also, but a little less since the font seems thicker
The two buttons should be left aligned
Text in all the buttons don’t seem optically centered. E.g. the two main buttons seem to need a few pixels up, while in the pop-up the 
Address has too much line height as well
In the buttons, you are missing the small text font for the small titles - see again figma as template
optional/for later: does it look stupid to have the small title font a size so that all titles display on one line?

Please review the spacing again based on the figma design
- space between the top of the page and the sweet skin title (also on mobile, sorry that was my bad in the design)
+ space between intro image and intro text
- space between the hover texts and the following image (desktop)
- space between all the buttons (very little space between the buttons in the pop-up), also only desktop
- space between the claim at the button and the address (this looks good on mobile though)
+ space between intro text and small titles, or less space between small titles and the accompanying text
Adjust the grey tone to be the same as in the figma file
Love the detail that we can click the pop-up away by clicking anywhere else
The buttons are missing the black hover. That is for the two main buttons as in the design, as well as the «senden», «info@sweet.skin» and «+41 41 511 70 11» buttons.
I will go through the site on a bigger screen asap, as I’m on my laptop
